      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a unique experience for everyone around the world. COVID-19 has caused more than 600 million cases and over 6.5 million deaths. The pandemic has lead to a wide variety of global change including, mask mandates, economic crashes, and mental health awareness. In response to the global pandemic the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) started recording adults who reported cases of depression, anxiety, or both in order to see how the pandemic has changed people’s mental health as it has progressed. </p>
    <p>According to the CDC just over 10% of adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in 2019 (before the pandemic). Furthermore, according to KFF in 2020 36% of adults reporte symptoms of anxiety or depression dissorder. A dramatic increase of over 3 times as many adults reporting either depression or anxiety. Accoridng to the CDC 6.5% reported cases of just having symptoms of depressiona dn according to KFF that number increased to 25.1% in 2020. The number for anxiety in 2019 was 8.1% and in 2020 according to KFF was 31.7%. The dramatic increase does not have one specific explanation other than the global pandemic. However, within the pandemic this couldbe due to a wide variety of things, PTSD from frontline workers, grief, loss of a “stigma” around mental health, or possibly the confinement brought with the national lockdown. </p>
<p>To discuss this data I talked to founder and board member of Illinois mental health chairty, “The Dyland Buckner Foundation”, Karen Buckner. Karen Buckner’s son Dylan took his own life in 2021 with many close to him beleiving this was due to the the effects of the pandemic. According to Karent the dramatic increase in mental illness symptoms does not surprise her. She added that despite not being any medical doctor she has learned a lot about mental health since starting the foundation. When she talked to local high school, Glenbrook North, earlier this year the counselors told her how the amount of students that would request time with them was not just a cause for concern but stressful for them as well. According to Karen the school was proud of their students for reaching out to someone after Dylan died but the councelors would frequently fill up their schedules and not accomodate all students in a day that needed help. </p>
<p>In 2021, many people began to become more accommodated with the pandemic, leading to a slight dip in reported mental illness numbers. According to KFF in 2021, 26.1% of adults reported symptoms of anxiety, 21.6% of adults reported symptoms of depression, and  30.4% of adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. The slight dip could be due to people becoming more used to the pandemic and the country loosening many of their stay-at-home restrictions. However, this number is still much higher than it was in 2019, still over 3 timesas high in each category. In 2022 however these numbers rose again. According to KFF 28.90% reported symptoms of anxiety, 22.40% reported symptoms of depression, and 32.80% reported symptoms of either anxiety or depression. This was due to the massive spike in US covid cases due to the Omnicron Variant entering the United Stated. </p>

<p>In early 2022 the United States saw it’s highest spike in cases due to the Omicron variant. Early January saw about 800,000 new cases on a per day basis compared to only about 200,000 in the year previous. Unsurprisingly, due to this massive increase in covid cases per day 2022 saw the mental illness reports rise again. Furthermore for the first full week of January 2022 (when COVID cases per day were at its highest) the numbers are even higher. 35.8% of adults reported symptoms of anixety, 28.4% reported symptoms of depression, and 41.1% of adults reported symptoms of either depression or anxiety. Furthermore, the age group of 18-29 (the range with the highest percentage of mental illness reports) was over 50%. This means that the Omircron variant was the result of over half of young adults self reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety and this does not account for those who did not report symptoms but still have them. 
<p>2020 saw the introduction to COVID-19 and thus a spike in anxiety and depression symptoms nationwide. In 2021 as the nation was trying to become more comfortable with the virus these numbers declined ever so slightly potentially beginning a trend for the future. However, 2022 led to the highest numbers in COVID cases per day which resulted in the re-rise in mental illness reports and astronomical numbers for younger age groups. With 2023 on the horizon and covid cases per day reverting back to the norm the world may see these numbers drop again barring any new variants popping up in the country. </p>
